## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Process Optimization

- **Problem:** Optimizing thermal zone setup in composite thermoforming  
- **Approach:** Deep RL (DQN, PPO) and multi-agent RL with transfer learning (MATRL)
- **Result:** Demonstrated improved efficiency using IR camera validation on physical setup  
- **Focus:** Centralized vs decentralized learning behavior for industrial control
